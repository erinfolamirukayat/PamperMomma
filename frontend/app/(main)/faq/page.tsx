        question: "What is PamperMomma?",
        answer: "PamperMomma is a platform that helps expecting and new mothers create service registries where friends and family can contribute to professional services like cleaning, meal prep, childcare, and more. Instead of traditional gifts, supporters can fund meaningful services that truly help during this important time."
    },
    {
        category: "Getting Started",
        question: "How do I create my first registry?",
        answer: "After signing up and completing onboarding, navigate to 'My Registries' and click 'Create New Pamper Registry'. You'll be guided through adding services, setting goals, and sharing your registry with loved ones."
    },
    {
        category: "Getting Started",
        question: "Is PamperMomma free to use?",
        answer: "Creating an account and setting up registries is free. We take a small processing fee from contributions to cover payment processing and platform maintenance costs."
    },
    {
        category: "Registries",
        question: "What types of services can I add to my registry?",
        answer: "You can add various services including house cleaning, meal preparation, grocery delivery, childcare, postpartum doula services, lawn care, pet care, and many other services that would help during your pregnancy or after your baby arrives."
    },
    {
        category: "Registries",
        question: "Can I have multiple registries?",
        answer: "Yes! You can create multiple registries for different occasions or time periods. For example, you might have one for pregnancy support and another for postpartum care."
    },
    {
        category: "Registries",
        question: "How do I share my registry with others?",
        answer: "Each registry has a unique shareable link that you can send via email, text message, or share on social media. Contributors don't need to create an account to make contributions."
    },
    {
        category: "Services",
        question: "How do I find service providers?",
        answer: "You can browse our network of verified service providers, or add your own trusted providers. Each provider's profile includes ratings, reviews, and service details to help you make informed choices."
    },
    {
        category: "Services",
        question: "What if a service provider isn't available when I need them?",
        answer: "We recommend booking services in advance when possible. If your preferred provider isn't available, we can help you find alternative providers with similar services and ratings."
    },
    {
        category: "Services",
        question: "Can I customize service details and pricing?",
        answer: "Yes! You can set specific service requirements, preferred dates, and work with providers to customize pricing based on your needs and location."
    },
    {
        category: "Contributions",
        question: "How do contributions work?",
        answer: "Contributors can fund partial or full services from your registry. Funds are held securely until you're ready to book the service. You'll receive notifications when contributions are made."
    },
    {
        category: "Contributions",
        question: "What payment methods are accepted?",
        answer: "We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, and digital payment methods. All transactions are processed securely through our encrypted payment system."
    },
    {
        category: "Contributions",
        question: "Can contributors see who else has contributed?",
        answer: "Contributors can see the total amount raised and progress toward the goal, but individual contribution amounts and contributor names are kept private unless the contributor chooses to leave a public message."
    },
    {
        category: "Contributions",
        question: "How do I receive the funds contributed to my registry?",
        answer: `<p>Getting your funds is a simple and secure process, powered by our trusted payment partner, Stripe. We've chosen Stripe, a global leader in online payments used by millions of businesses, to ensure your financial information is handled with the highest level of security and privacy.</p>
        <p class="font-bold mt-4">Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>One-Time Payout Setup:</strong> Before your first withdrawal, you'll find a "Set Up Payouts" button in your dashboard. Clicking this will take you to a secure onboarding form hosted directly by Stripe.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Information Collection:</strong> You will provide your personal and bank account details directly to Stripe on their secure form. <strong>PamperMomma's servers never see, handle, or store this sensitive data.</strong> Stripe uses this information to verify your identity and securely link your bank account for transfers, in compliance with global financial regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawing Your Funds:</strong> Once your payout account is set up, you can withdraw your available balance at any time from your registry dashboard. When you initiate a withdrawal, Stripe securely processes the transfer, and the funds will typically arrive in your bank account within a few business days.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mt-4">By using Stripe Connect, you can be confident that your transactions are safe and your privacy is protected, allowing you to focus on what matters mostâ€”preparing for your new baby.</p>
